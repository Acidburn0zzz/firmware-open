# firmware-open

System76 Open Source Firmware

## Dependencies

### Install toolchain
```
./scripts/deps.sh
```

### Load Rust environment (or optionally reboot)
```
source ~/.cargo/env
```

### Build firmware, replace darp5 with your model (look in the models directory for examples)
```
./scripts/build.sh darp5
```

### Flashing firmware manually is not recommended for the normal user. For the advanced user, there is a script flash.sh which takes the same arguments as build.sh
