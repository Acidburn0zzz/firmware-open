# System76 Open Firmware

An open source distribution of firmware utilizing coreboot, EDK2, and System76 firmware applications.

## Dependencies

### Install toolchain
```
./scripts/deps.sh
```

### Load Rust environment (or optionally reboot)
```
source ~/.cargo/env
```

### Build firmware, replace qemu with your model (look in the models directory for examples)
```
./scripts/build.sh qemu
```

### Emulate firmware, only available after building the qemu model
```
./scripts/qemu.sh
```

### Flashing firmware manually is not recommended for the normal user. For the advanced user, there is a script flash.sh which takes the same arguments as build.sh
